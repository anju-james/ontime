### Flight Status
Ontime is a flight status look up and flight alert web application that tracks the domestic flight statuses and details in the USA. Users can check for the status of their flights by entering the source airport and destination airport and the date they are travelling. The system picks up all the flights scheduled on the selected date from the source airport to the destination airport. For advanced filtering, the user can also enter the flight number which fetches only the relevant flight data of interest to the user.

### Flight Status Alert Subscriptions
The users are also given the option to subscribe for alerts for specific flights in our web application. On subscribing to alerts, an email and a text SMS message will be sent to the userâ€™s email and phone number with the information regarding their flights.

### Airport Chat Forum
